# Matrix Calculation for Data Science

Matrix calculation is one of the _main knowledge_ required in several field to **solve problems** that involve several unknown variables. For example, in chemistry we have the following problem;

1. A chemist need to make 2 liters of a $15\%$ acid solution from $10\%$ acid solution and a $35\%$ acid solution. How many liters of each should the chemist mix to get the desired solution?

In Bioengineering, matrix calculation is also an important tool for different application. For example, 

2. A biologist needs to run three different experiments using three elemental compounds; sodium pyruvate ($x_1$), glutamine ($x_2$), and glucose ($x_3$) to support cells growth. For the first, second and thirds experiments, the biologist has modeled the growth of the cell as follow $x_1+2x_2+6x_3=8$ give a growing rate of 8 cells per hours, $x_1-x_2+4x_3=5$ give a growing rate of 5 cells per hours, and $2x_1+x_2+10x_3=13$ give a growing rate of 13 cells per hours, respectively. If we define each variable as the amount of concentration (mass/volume), what is the amount of concentration required for each experiment to obtain the given growing rate?

3. Google's Page rank is one of the main application of matrix computation, in particular its search engine uses \textbf{eigenvalues and eigenvectors}. At the early of google, its engine used to deliver the most relevant result for our search queries. Let see this case,
